# AIRBNB CLONE - THE CONSOLE
This repository implements the Control Console for the AirBnb clone project and the
first stage for a DB implementation related to the class instances' serialization and deserialization process.


It has a Unittest suite test for a 100% quality software.

## Use examples
1. Run and get help on how to use it, create a new instance and check for all instances already created:

2. Use a method for each class and exit the Console:
